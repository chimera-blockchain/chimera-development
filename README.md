Telegram currently hosts the [main channel](https://t.me/chimeranetwork) for Chimera Network and submission of ideas and feedback is encouraged.  This can be done by simply creating a free Github account (takes 2 minutes) and then creating an Issue in the [Issues Tab].(https://github.com/chimera-blockchain/chimera-development/issues).

Issues can be attached to projects they relate to and also have labels applied to help indicate what they are for - i.e. "Idea", "Feedback", "Bug", "Enhancement" etc.  Issues can be commented on by Team members or other community members to provide frequent interaction and encourage development progress:
1. [Create Issue](https://github.com/chimera-blockchain/chimera-development/issues) with details for idea
    1. Set type to "Idea"
    2. Assign to [project "Community Ideas"](https://github.com/chimera-blockchain/chimera-development/projects/1)
2. This will be reviewed by the Chimera Network Development Team and comments added to the Issue if required
3. The issue will then be updated:
    1. Merged with additional issues leading up to the definition of a new project or development activity
    2. Remain in the Ideas project with comments to advise when last reviewed
    3. Closed with comments advising why it is closed and won't be taken forward
